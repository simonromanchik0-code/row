# Personal Dashboard

A set of small, self-contained HTML apps that share a top bar.

## Deploy your own copy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRowanThistlebrooke%2FYTdashh1)

One click → Vercel signs you in, copies the repo to your GitHub, and deploys it. ~30 seconds to a live URL.

## How to use

Open any `.html` file directly in your browser — no build step, no install.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [index.html](index.html) | Goals tracker (Day Ring, Goal Ticker, To Do list) — the home page |
| [health.html](health.html) | Supplement / daily stack tracker |
| [po-water.html](po-water.html) | Water intake tracker |
| [finance.html](finance.html) | Finances |
| [gym.html](gym.html) | Progressive overload gym tracker |
| [topbar.js](topbar.js) | Shared top bar — auto-injected into pages that `<script src="topbar.js">` |

Each app stores its own state in browser `localStorage`. No accounts, no server.

## Cloud sync setup (Supabase)

Cross-device sync (goals, stack, water, finance, gym state) relies on a
`public.app_state` table with anon RLS policies for select/insert/update.

Progress photos (`gym.html`) sync via Supabase Storage instead of being
crammed into that JSONB row. Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor to
create the bucket and its access policies:

```sql
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('progress-photos', 'progress-photos', true)
on conflict (id) do update set public = true;

drop policy if exists "anon upload progress-photos" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "anon read progress-photos"   on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "anon delete progress-photos" on storage.objects;

create policy "anon upload progress-photos"
  on storage.objects for insert with check (bucket_id = 'progress-photos');

create policy "anon read progress-photos"
  on storage.objects for select using (bucket_id = 'progress-photos');

create policy "anon delete progress-photos"
  on storage.objects for delete using (bucket_id = 'progress-photos');
```

## Building from scratch

[BUILD_DASHBOARD.md](BUILD_DASHBOARD.md) is the prompt I gave Claude to generate `index.html` — paste it into Claude if you want to rebuild that page yourself.
